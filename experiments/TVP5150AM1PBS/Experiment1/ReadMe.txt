Experiment 1: First attempt at reading YCbCr output from the TVP5150AM1

Exact setup can be seen in schematic, where [Camera name] is connected to Ch1 as an analog video input source for the device.

Result: No output. Rereading the manual found that registers would need to be configured over I2C first.
